# Leaderboard App
Creating a leaderboard app that creates virtual rooms and after completion uploads to Strava.
Using Flask, HTMX, SocketIO and  ...

## Todo:
c-login and user profile  
c-create data stream to generate fit files for testing purpose   
-ui for most pages   
-encoder   
-device accessibility   
-room state   
Update 1/2/24:
I've got bits and pieces done on all of the components of the progect. I do need to get a speed sensor, cadence sensor, and test a trainer to improve the accessibility with different devices.   

Before I do that I need to work on the encoder part of the project. Right now I have a example, I don't think it will be hardto convert that into a C# sever just need to better understand C# ecosystem.   

I also have to work on the UI for leaderboards. Probably try to figma something up quickly. I want to finish before school starts, but unlikely considering I have delayed aquiring sensors and stuff.
